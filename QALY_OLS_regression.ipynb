    "\n",
    "To build predictive models for estimating Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY), we have to understand the two variable that need to be taken into account. Life years and Health-related quality of life (instruments measured in units between 0 and 1). Health-related quality of life (HRQL) focuses on the impact of health on a personâ€™s ability to live a fulfilling life. HRQL represents a broad concepts of physical, psychological with social functioning and well-being that includes both positive and negative aspects.  For people with chronic medical conditions such as Obesity, Coronary Heart Disease and Diabetes, this also  includes how their disease and treatment affect disability and every day function. \n",
    "\n",
    "We build a predictive model for HRQL using Python and integrate the results into Power BI for visualization, we'll follow a structured approach involving data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and integration with Power BI. Here's a detailed technical outline of the steps involved:\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "* *Model Goodness-of-fit*: The independent variables in the model explain 60.2% of the variance in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Model Significance:* A high F-statistic with a very low p-value indicates that the overall model is statistically significant, meaning the model provides a good fit for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Gender:* Gender is not a statistically significant predictor of HRQL in this model, suggesting that there is no clear relationship between gender and HRQL in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Marital Status:* Marital status is a significant predictor. Being married, compared to being single, is associated with a decrease in HRQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Age:* Age is a significant predictor, with each additional year of age associated with a decrease in HRQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *BMI:* BMI is highly significant, but contrary to some expectations, an increase in BMI is associated with an increase in HRQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Coronary Heart Disease:* This condition significantly decreases HRQL, indicating a strong negative impact on HRQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Diabetes:* Diabetes has a negligible and statistically insignificant effect on HRQL in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Literature shows mixed results, with some studies suggesting males might have better HRQL, but this relationship varies across populations. However, consistent with literature, older individuals tend to have lower HRQL compared to younger individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the model is statistically significant, the model does not account for other significant factors affecting HRQL, such as lifestyle choices and various exogenous and endogenous influences.Further categoring data and focusing on specific population groups would result in a more accurate relationship bewteen HRQL and the obsevered patient conditions and lifestyle choices. Overall, while the model provides significant insights into the factors affecting HRQL, addressing the identified limitations and incorporating additional relevant variables could enhance its explanatory power and accuracy and improve patient-centered healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Targeted Interventions for Older Adults:** Implement preventive care and wellness programs tailored for older adults to mitigate the decline in HRQL associated with aging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Chronic Disease Management:** Enhance chronic disease management programs to address conditions prevalent in older populations, which can impact HRQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Support for Married Individuals:** Provide marital counseling and support services to address potential stressors that may negatively impact HRQL for married individuals. Also develop family health programs that focus on improving overall family well-being, which may indirectly improve the HRQL of married individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Monitoring and Managing BMI:** Offer personalized nutrition and fitness programs to help individuals maintain a healthy BMI. Despite the counterintuitive finding that increased BMI is associated with higher HRQL, it is crucial to consider the overall health implications of BMI. Educate patients on the importance of healthy weight management and its long-term benefits for physical and mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Coronary Heart Disease Prevention and Management:** Strengthen cardiovascular health initiatives, including regular screenings, lifestyle modifications, and medical interventions to prevent and manage coronary heart disease. Educate patients about the risk factors and early signs of coronary heart disease to promote early detection and intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance patient well-being and address the factors impacting HRQL, healthcare providers should conduct comprehensive health assessments that include lifestyle factors not covered in the current model, such as diet, physical activity, and mental health. Adopting a holistic approach to healthcare that considers both physical and mental health aspects is crucial, given the multifaceted nature of HRQL. Improving data collection methods to ensure a more representative and normally distributed dataset is essential. This may involve gathering additional variables that influence HRQL and expanding the scope of self-evaluated quality of life survey questions. Additionally, regularly updating predictive models with new data and insights will help ensure healthcare recommendations remain relevant and effective. Implementing these strategies will enable healthcare providers to more effectively address the diverse factors influencing HRQL and enhance overall patient well-being.\n",
