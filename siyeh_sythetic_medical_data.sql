 /* FRAME A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR QUALITY OF LIFE BASED ON  OBSERVATIONS
 A healthcare organization is conducting a study to assess the quality of life among patients based on specific health observations recorded in a database. 
 QALY is a measure that combines life expectancy with quality of life considerations. It's used in health economics to assess the overall impact of health interventions 
 or conditions on an individual's well-being and life span. Economic assessment of a medical intervantion. QALY=Life Expectancy (in years) Ã— Health-related Quality of Life (QoL)
 The EQ-5D index score can be calculated using country-specific value sets or weights assigned to different health states. For instance, the UK value set assigns values (utilities)
 to each health state ranging from 0 (equivalent to death) to 1 (perfect health).*/
